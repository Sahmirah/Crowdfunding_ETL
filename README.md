# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Project 2: 
For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

For this project I utilized Jupyter Notebooks to create my 4 dataframes: Campaign, Contacts, Category, and Sub-Category. I utilized PgAdmin to create my Crowdfunding Database and schema. I also created a ERD showing the relationships between the dataframes.
